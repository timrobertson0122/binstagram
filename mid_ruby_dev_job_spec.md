At Populi, we're looking for an **experienced** Ruby developer to join our team. We're working on several different projects, and you would be able to participate in full-stack development across a variety of different applications.

We are primarily a Ruby shop, so most of the server-side development will be in Ruby on Rails. **We require at least 2 years of experience working with Rails applications.**

We use a pretty standard stack: - Ruby - Postgresql - Memcached - Puma - Nginx - Haml/Slim template engines. and we use Linux  on our servers.

We will also do front-end development as we're developing mobile applications based on the HTML5 stack. This may include front-end frameworks like Ember or React depending on the situation. Javascript knowledge is a plus.

Examples of our projects:

* Big website in the tourism sector (This is a really interesting project)
* B2B Applications for our customers
* Tourist reservation platform, to be used by multiple companies to manage reservations, online tickets, on-site sales, partners, resellers, and API integration with various providers
* Mobile Audioguides to improve the old audioguide system, and extend the concept to smartphones
* Geolocated application for tourists

You will be able to contribute to these various projects on both the client-side and server-side. You will also help the development/maintenance of existing applications once you're up to speed with the domain knowledge.


Tasks will include:

* development of brand new features/products
bug fixes/tickets
* creating prototypes to explore new solutions and products
* writing and maintaining automated tests

Joining our company would be a good opportunity for someone who likes working on cool projects and technologies, and who is willing to experiment and learn.

We'd really like to find someone who embraces the project and wants to grow with us, for a long-term relationship.

We are always open to new tech and I have a particular interest in the Elixir language, which we may use in the future.

Interested?  jobs@populi.io
